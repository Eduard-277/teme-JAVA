7    10       "She's having the time of her life"
5    9        There in her glittering prime
10   19       The lights refract sequined stars off her silhouette every night
9    13       I can show you lies (one, two, three, four)
11   13    *  'Cause I'm a real tough kid, I can handle my shit
14   20       THEY SAID, "BABE, YOU GOTTA FAKE IT 'TIL YOU MAKE IT" AND I DID
9    16       LIGHTS, CAMERA, BITCH SMILE, EVEN WHEN YOU WANNA DIE
8    11       He said he'd love me all his life
6    8        But that life was too short
6    8        Breaking down, I hit the floor
12   17       ALL THE PIECES OF ME SHATTERED AS THE CROWD WAS CHANTING, "MORE"
11   11       I was grinning like I'm winning, I was hitting my marks
13   19       'Cause I can do it with a broken heart (one, two, three, four)
11   13       I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
12   18       I'm so obsessed with him but he avoids me like the plague
12   12       I cry a lot but I am so productive, it's an art
10   16    *  You know you're good when you can even do it
4    6        With a broken heart
5    4        I CAN HOLD MY BREATH
7    10       I've been doing it since he left
7    9        I keep finding his things in drawers
8    16       Crucial evidence, I didn't imagine the whole thing
11   13       I'm sure I can pass this test (one, two, three, four)
11   13    *  'Cause I'm a real tough kid, I can handle my shit
14   20       They said, "Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it" and I did
8    14       Lights, camera, bitch smile, in stilettos for miles
8    11       He said he'd love me for all time
6    9        But that time was quite short
6    8        Breaking down, I hit the floor
12   17       All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, "More"
11   11       I was grinning like I'm winning, I was hitting my marks
12   17       'CAUSE I CAN DO IT WITH A BROKEN HEART (ONE, TWO, THREE)
11   13       I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
15   23       I'm so obsessed with him but he avoids me like the plague (he avoids me)
12   12       I CRY A LOT BUT I AM SO PRODUCTIVE, IT'S AN ART
10   16    *  You know you're good when you can even do it
4    6        With a broken heart
10   16    *  You know you're good when you can even do it
4    6        WITH A BROKEN HEART
6    10       You know you're good, I'm good
3    7        'Cause I'm miserable
4    5        And nobody even knows
6    5        Try and come for my job
